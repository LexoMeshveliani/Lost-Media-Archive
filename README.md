# Lost Media Archive

A retro-themed web archive for forgotten and lost media: games, comics, movies, VHS tapes, arcade exclusives, and vintage magazines.

**This is my first ever web project, created for a university assignment and as part of my personal portfolio.**

## Features

- Browse categories of lost media with pixel-art inspired design
- View detailed entries for each item, including images and descriptions
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Animated video backgrounds for immersive nostalgia
